            <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's work in missile development focused on building India's indigenous

            <p>The Project Director of the SLV-III project was Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. He was instrumental in the development of India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle, which successfully
                placed the Rohini satellite into near-Earth orbit in July 1980, making India a member of the "Space Club".</p>
