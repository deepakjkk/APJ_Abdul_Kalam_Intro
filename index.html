                <h1>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and
                    aerospace engineering. He spent four decades as a scientist and science administrator at the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was
                    known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                    Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002, with support from both the ruling Bharatiya
                    Janata Party and the opposition Indian National Congress. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's
                    highest civilian honor. Kalam died from an apparent cardiac arrest at the age of 83.</p>
